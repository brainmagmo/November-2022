Sakila Database

Write a SQL statement for each of the following. 

1. Get 10 cities in descending alphabetical order.

2. Get all films with "airplane" in the title.

3. Get the highest payment amount.

4. Get the number of records in the customer table for store id #1.

5. Get all payment records for customer with email address "NANCY.THOMAS@sakilacustomer.org"

6. Use a View to get the film info for actor Bob Fawcett.

7. Use a Stored Procedure to get the 4 inventory ids for the film "Alien Center" at Store #2. 

8. Insert a new store. Ensure that you use TRANSACTION. (This one is possible but it's tough! Pay attention to constraints and the order that you are inserting data.) 

9. Update the timestamp to the current date/time for the new store you entered in the previous question. 

10. Delete the new store. 

11. Using one SQL statement, get how many films are there in each rating category.

12. Get (in order) the first and last names of the 3 customers who have spent the most, along with how much they have paid overall.

13. Get all movies rented by the customer who spent the most. (Hint: This will either require nested queries, or more than two joins. one approach is much shorter than the other.)

14. Get the first and last names of all customers who spent more than $150, along with how much they spent.

Do not hard code IDs.
